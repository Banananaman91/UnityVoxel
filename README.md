## Voxel-based Shader
Material shader uses voxel values to map textures to the mesh, using Barycentric coordinates for per-triangle texturing and Triplanar Mapping with individual offsets.

## Voxel-based VFX control tool
Scriptable objects with custom GUI allows the ability to control VFX properties and call specific VFX based on voxel type, allowing all unique VFX based on voxel type and interaction size
